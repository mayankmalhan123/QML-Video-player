# qml_video_player
Build with Qt Creator 5.15
# Notes
Please check the video **QML_video.mp4** for the result  <br />
There's only 1 requirement that I don't really understand and didn't implement is: Revent the device from getting screen auto-locked while the video is playing. The complete features are on the list below <br /><br />
**Done:**  <br />
- Loads a video file from File Picker dialog
- Have a play and pause buttons and a progress slider <br />
- Slider should also allow user to drag to seek playback position of the video file thatâ€™s being played. <br />
- Ability to pinch to zoom on the video and pan. <br />
- Use QML <br />
- Implement platform specific File Picker/Dialog API using C++ <br />
